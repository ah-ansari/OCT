1. __init__.py:
	* commented benchmark
2. recourse_methods\__init__.py
	* remove unsued methods
3. recourse_methods\catalog\__init__.py
	* comment unsued methods
4. recourse_methods\processing\counterfactuals.py
	* change check_counterfactuals funcion, so that it will set the ones without predict==1 as nan
5. models\catalog\ANN_TF\model_ann.py	
	* fix tesnorflow related errors. CARLA uses tf v1 but we haevtf v2.
6. models\catalog\Linear_TF\model_linear.py
	* fix tesnorflow related errors. CARLA uses tf v1 but we haevtf v2.
7. recourse_methods\autoencoder\models\autoencoder.py
	* fix tesnorflow related errors. CARLA uses tf v1 but we haevtf v2.
8. recourse_methods\autoencoder\losses\losses.py
	* fix tesnorflow related errors. CARLA uses tf v1 but we haevtf v2.	
	
Growing Spheres changes:	
9. recourse_methods\catalog\growing_spheres\library\gs_counterfactuals.py
	* apply clipping to [0, 1]
	* check for the target class as 1. CARLA considers cfs as those changing to the class different from the original class of the query. But, we consider query from class 0 and target class 1.
	
CCHVAE changes:
10. recourse_methods\autoencoder\models\vae.py
	* set device as cpu
11. recourse_methods\catalog\cchvae\model.py
	* set device as cpu
	* change the chekcings for target class to be 1

Revise:
12. recourse_methods\catalog\revise\model.py
	* set device as cpu
	* use predict_proba_diff instead of predict_proba function. Since, predict_proba returns numpy array.
	* The above is in two functions ()
	
CRUD:
13. recourse_methods\catalog\crud\library\crud.py
	* set device to cpu
	* changed from predict_proba to predict_proba_diff
14. recourse_methods\autoencoder\models\csvae.py
	* added sigmoid as the final activation function to make the final values be between 0 and 1

FeatureTweak:
15. recourse_methods\catalog\feature_tweak\model.py
	* added MlModel to the list of the first if in def predict function
	* added class_labels as input to handle the multi-class case
	* Probably this is a bug, the model should check that the model predicts another label, not the tree (line )
	
processing:
16. recourse_methods\processing\counterfactuals.py
	* modified the line that gets the prediction to only include those that are not nan	
	
	
growing spheres, cchvae: added sklearn to the list of supported models.

Face:
17. recourse_methods\catalog\face\model.py
    * changed the data to df_train. In original code, df was used which is wrong (only training data should be used). Also, used only clean data by applying the OOD oracle.
18. recourse_methods\catalog\face\library\face_method.py
    * We consider all the features to be mutable, the current code produces an error when the list of immutable features is empty, applied changes to resolve this issue.s
19. recourse_methods\catalog\face\library\face_method.py
    * There is a bug in the code that they do not change the index of the factual sample after a subsample of the data is selected randomly in line 40. I added some modification to handle that. I found this bug from an error in the case that index of the factual sample is larger than the subsample size.
